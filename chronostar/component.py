"""
Class object that encapsulates a component, the phase-space model
of an unbound set of stars formed from the same starburst/filament.

A component models the initial phase-space distribution of stars
as a Gaussian. As such there are three key attributes:
- mean: the central location
- covariance matrix: the spread in each dimension along with any correlations
- age: how long the stars have been travelling

Method decorators are used for two methods of AbstractComponent.

load_components() is a "static" method (and hence has a @staticmethod
decorator). This means that it can be called directly from the Class, e.g.:
my_comps = SphereComponent.load_components('filename')
In practical terms, this method has no 'self' in the signature and thus
cannot access any attributes that would otherwise be accessible by e.g.
self.blah

get_sensible_walker_spread() is a "class" method (and hence has a
@classmethod decorator). This means that it can be called directly from
the Class, e.g.:
sensible_spread = SphereComponent.get_sensible_walker_spread()
This is similar to a static method, but needs access to the class
attribute SENSIBLE_WALKER_SPREADS.
In practical terms, instead of the first argument of the method's
signature being 'self', it is 'cls', meaning the method has access to
the class attributes.

It doesn't make sense for these methods to be used by instantiated objects
of the class, but they are still very closely tied to the Class. They could
be left in the global namespace of this module, however then two separate
imports would be required throughout Chronostar, and it would complicate
the process of plugging in a different, modularised Component class.

    An abstract class that (when implmented) encapsulates a component,
    the phase-space model of an unbound set of stars formed from the
    same starburst/filament.

    A component models the initial phase-space distribution of stars
    as a Gaussian. As such there are three key attributes:
    - mean: the central location
    - covariance matrix: the spread in each dimension along with any
    correlations
    - age: how long the stars have been travelling

    This class has been left abstract so as to easily facilitate
    (and encourage) alternate parameterisations of components.

    In brief, just copy-paste SphereComponent below to make your new
    class, and modify the methods and attribute to suit your new
    parametrisation.

    In order to implement this class and make a concrete class, only
    one variable must be set, and four methods implmented. In short,
    the class must be told how to turn raw parameters into attributes,
    and vice verse.

    Attributes to set:
    `PARAMETER_FORMAT`
        This parameter must be set. An ordered list of labels
        describing what purpose each input serves. e.g. for a
        SphereComponent, the list is
        3*['pos'] + 3*['vel'] + ['log_pos_std', 'log_vel_std', 'age']
        See `SENSIBLE_WALKER_SPREADS` for a set of viable labels, and
        include your own as needed! Note that this is the parameters in
        "internal form", i.e. the form of the parameter space that
        emcee explores.

    Methods to define
    internalise(pars) and externalise(pars)
        You must tell the Component class how to switch between internal
        and external formats. These methods are static because there is
        not always a need to instantiate an entire Component object
        simply to convert between parameter forms.

        There is perhaps scope to have the Component class to intuit
        how to convert between forms based on `PARAMETER_FORMAT` values.
    _set_covmatrix(covmatrix=None), (REQUIRED)
    _set_mean(mean=None), _set_age(age=None) (both optional)
        These methods instruct the class how to (if input is None) build
        the attribute from self.pars, or (if input is provided) to set
        the self._mean (for e.g.) attribute but also to reverse engineer
        the self.pars values and update accordingly.

        These methods should only be called internally, (from the
        __init__() method, or the update_attributes() method) as it is
        critical to do some tidying up (setting mean_now and
        covmatrix_now to None) whenever self.pars is modified.

        If you stick to the convention of the mean=pars[:6] and
        age=pars[-1] then the default methods will suffice and you will
        only need to implement _set_covmatrix(). Of course if you wish,
        you can override _set_mean() or _set_age().

            that have real units, then use this argument.
        emcee_pars: 1D float array_like
            Raw values for the parameters of the component but in
            converted style used by emcee (e.g. log space for standard
            deviations etc). In simple terms, if you are initialising
            a component based on parameters taken from an emcee chain,
            then use this argument.
        attributes: dict with all the following keys:
            mean: [6] float array_like
                The mean of the initial Gaussian distribution in
                cartesian space:
                [X(pc), Y(pc), Z(pc), U(km/s), V(km/s), W(km/s)]
            covmatrix: [6,6] float array_like
                the covariance matrix of the initial Gaussian
                distribution, with same units as `mean`
            age: float
                the age of the component (positive) in millions of
                years
        trace_orbit_func: function {trace_cartesian_orbit}
            Function used to calculate an orbit through cartesian space
            (centred on, and co-rotating with, the local standard of
            rest). Function must be able to take two parameters, the
            starting location and the age, with positive age
            corrsponding to forward evolution, and negative age
            backward evolution. It should also be "odd", i.e.:
